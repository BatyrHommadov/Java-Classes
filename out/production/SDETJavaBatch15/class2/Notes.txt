Java follows some rules for naming things like classes and boxes (Variables).

1) While naming a class, first letter of all the words should uppercase. For example: DecimalNumbers
2) While giving names to variables or boxes, first letter of all the words should be uppercase, except for the first word.
   For example: myBox

Primitive data types:
    byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
