Logical Operators:
Just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean values. There are three logical
operators: !|| &&

Why should we learn about the logical operators?
    We can greatly simplify the logic if we use these operators

What is the syntax:
    They only work with boolean data type
    if(! condition)
    if(condition1 || condition2)
    if(condition1 && condition2)

NOT operator (!)
    Not is used to negate the boolean values if something is true it will make it false, and if something is false
    it will make it true

OR Operator (||)

AND Operator (&&)

Switch Case
what is SwitchCase statement:
    SwitchCase statements are just another of way of achieving the results as if-else-if conditions
Why should we learn about them:
    The reason we should use them is they are very fast.

Syntax:
String var:
    switch(var){
    case1:
    sout"1"
    break;
    }
Rules to follow:
We can only use byte, short, int, char and String
We can't use logical operators
We can't use relational operators
