Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions (as many as you wish). They only work with
    boolean (true or false) values. There are three logical operators:
    1) ! NOT
    2) || OR
    3) && AND

 Why should we use them?
    1) They can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) It helps us to reduce lines of codes that we have to write.

NOT (!):
    it reverses the condition. If something is true it will make it false and if something is false it will make it true.
    System.out.println(!true) => false

OR (||):
    it can combines two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is one of the conditins is true.
    if all conditions become false it returns a false.

AND (&&):
    it can also combine two or more conditions.It only returns true if all conditions are true.
